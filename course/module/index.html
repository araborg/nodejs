            Module in Node.js:
            ==================

            In Node.js, a module is a self-contained unit of code---typically 
            a single JavaScript file---that encapsulates specific functionality 
            to be reused throughout an application. Instead of having one 
            massive file, you break your code into smaller, manageable pieces 
            that communicate with each other. 
            
            Key Characteristics:

            Private Scope: 
            By default, variables and functions defined in a module are private 
            to that file and cannot be accessed from the outside unless explicitly 
            exported.

            Caching: 
            When a module is loaded for the first time using require(), Node.js 
            caches it. Subsequent requests for the same module return the cached 
            version, improving performance.

            Organized Code: 
            Modules help follow the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle and 
            keep the global namespace clean

            Types of Modules
            Core Modules: 
            Built-in libraries that come with Node.js and don't require installation 
            (e.g., fs for file systems, http for servers, and path for file paths).
            
            Local Modules: 
            Custom files created by you within your project.
            
            Third-Party Modules: 
            Packages created by the community and installed via npm (e.g., Express 
            or Mongoose). 
            
            How to Use Them
            Node.js supports two module systems: 
            
            CommonJS (CJS): 
            The traditional default. Use module.exports to share code and require() 
            to import it.
            
            ES Modules (ESM): 
            The modern JavaScript standard. Use export and import statements 
            (requires setting "type": "module" in your package.json).


            Examples:
            // math.js
            const add = (a, b) => a + b;
            const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

            // Exporting multiple functions as an object
            module.exports = { add, subtract };

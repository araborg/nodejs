            In Node.js, a module is a self-contained unit of code—typically 
            a single JavaScript file—that encapsulates specific functionality 
            to be reused throughout an application. Instead of having one 
            massive file, you break your code into smaller, manageable pieces 
            that communicate with each other. 
            
            Key Characteristics
            Private Scope: 
            By default, variables and functions defined in a module are private 
            to that file and cannot be accessed from the outside unless explicitly 
            exported.

            Caching: 
            When a module is loaded for the first time using require(), Node.js 
            caches it. Subsequent requests for the same module return the cached 
            version, improving performance.

            Organized Code: Modules help follow the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle and keep the global namespace clean
